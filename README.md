## Pipes
A version of the classic pipes game where you must lay pip between each pair of nodes without the pipes crossing each other.  This version has puzzles ranging from 5 x 5 to 9 x 9.

## Game Play

The initial splash screen is animated and shows pipes being layed.  The user can skip this and jump straight to the action by pressing the 'A' button.  The 'B' button toggles the sound on and off.

The game has six levels ranging from super easy to hard.  The easy puzzles have a 5 x 5 cell configuration and they increase in size to 9 x 9.  Press 'A' to select a level or 'B' to return to the front splash screen.

Depending on the level chosen, the board may fit onto the screen or you may need to scroll up and down to see the action.  Pressing 'A' on a node will select that node.

Pressing the 'B' button will return you to the level select if no node has been selected.  Alternatively, if a node has been selected, pressing 'B' will erase the pipe that is currently being layed.
